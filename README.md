# RockPaperScissors

This is a Rock, paper, scissors game built in python. Played against the computer, a random choice generator. It responds to strictly "rock", "paper" and "scissors". Any other input will result in the programme restarting until the correct choices are made. If the game ends in a win or lose for the plater, the programme ends. If the result is a tie, the programme will restart until a definite winner is made.
